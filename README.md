# Innoweb LuxPulse UI Prototype

This project contains a runnable React + Vite + TypeScript build of the LuxPulse UI prototype. The UI lives in
`src/LuxPulseUIPrototype.tsx` and is rendered through `src/App.tsx`.

## How to run
1. Install dependencies:
   npm install
2. Start dev server:
   npm run dev
3. Build for production (checks TypeScript and creates `dist/`):
   npm run build

## Notes
- The prototype showcases the monitoring dashboard: map markers, status breakdown, alert list, and charts for stability
  and weather snapshots.
- Build artifacts such as `dist/` and `tsconfig.tsbuildinfo` are excluded from version control.

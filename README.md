# Innoweb LuxPulse UI Prototype

This zip contains a runnable React + Vite + TypeScript scaffold for the LuxPulse UI prototype.

## How to run
1. Install dependencies:
   npm install
2. Start dev server:
   npm run dev

## Important
The full UI prototype currently lives in the ChatGPT Canvas document:
**"Lux Pulse Ui Prototype (map + Monitoring)"**

Because the canvas content is not directly accessible as a file from this environment, the `src/LuxPulseUIPrototype.tsx`
file in this zip is a placeholder. Replace it with the full canvas code, then update `src/App.tsx` if needed.

If you want, paste the canvas file here and I’ll regenerate the zip with the full code embedded.
